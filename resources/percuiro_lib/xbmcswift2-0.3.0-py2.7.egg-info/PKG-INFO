        ~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A micro framework to enable rapid development of XBMC plugins.
        
        
        Features
        ````````
        
        * Run the addon from the command line *or* within XBMC without changing any
          code.
        * Helper libraries to make common XBMC api operations easy, like adding items,
          getting settings, creating temporary files, etc.
        * Handles all the url parsing involved in plugin routing. No need to deal with
          complicated URLs and query strings.

        This module is now available in the official XBMC Eden repository as
        xbmcswift2.
        
        This project is the next version of xbmcswift. While the APIs are similar,
        there are a few things that are not backwards compatible with the original
        version, hence the new name.
