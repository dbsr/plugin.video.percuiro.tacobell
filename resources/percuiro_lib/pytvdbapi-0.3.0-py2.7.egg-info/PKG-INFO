            >>> len(search)
            1
            >>> show = search[0]

            'How I Met Your Mother'

        Known Issues
        ============
          * At the moment, **pytvdbapi** only works with Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2,
            **NOT 3.0 or 3.1**. This is due to an
            `issue <http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=195>`_
            with httplib2 on Python 3.0, 3.1.
          * **pytvdbapi** does currently **NOT** support the use of Proxy Servers.
