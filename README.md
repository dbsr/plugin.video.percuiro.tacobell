### Description
Percurio Taco Bell is a video plugin for xbmc. You can use it to search for
video files using a combination of search providers.
The providers which are included by default are filestube, theextopia and downtr.


### Features
- Search & Play
    This will search all providers in turn (sorted by customizable provider
    priority) until it finds a playable result. Playable means the file exists
    on the filehost in question and is resolvable to a link the user can 
    download.

- Search all enabled providers
    Although it's possible to search a specific provider it's way more 
    delicious to search all providers at once. Fiesta!

- Add your own providers
    I've tried to make it very easy for you to add your own search providers.
    Having a look at the default providers would be a good start if you 
    want to add your own provider (if you succeed, please dont hestitate
    to send them to me or even better, submit a pull request!


### Important
This plugin will not work if you don't have some sort of premium account to
either a specific filehost or multi host. Although you will still get results
without a specified url resolver, you will be one sad burrito.
